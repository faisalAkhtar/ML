I am Faisal Akhtar. I am an apprentice in web development.

From building basic informational websites like [MyFastClaim](https://myfastclaim.com), [Sociovation](https://sociovation.in), etc. to complex webapps like [MFC's Claimant Dashboard](https://myfastclaim.com/client), [MFC's Insurance Company's Dashboard](https://myfastclaim.com/client), etc. I have come a long way learning a lot of things along with my partner and best-bud <a href="https://goyalshubhangi.github.io">Shubhangi</a>

I have worked with Firebase-auth, AWS - ACM(for SSL/TLS certification), Route53, Cloudfront, S3 bucket, NoSQL, MySQL, GitHub and Docker.

I am a keen learner with a high grasping power. I love to travel with my earphones on. Biryani is my first love :heart:
